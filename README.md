# pomodoro_timer
I made a Pomodoro style study countdown timer since it's a tool I find really helpful during the school year! I wanted to practice using python and make something useful for school starting back up again. I plan to use this sometimes when doing homework because it's more fun making something when you know you're going to use it! At the start of the program, the user determines how long each work/break session will be. The user also chooses a theme for celebratory emojis that appear during the long break. Since it's a Pomodoro timer, after four work sessions the user receives a longer break. The program also tracks some statistics such as total amount of work time minutes, number of breaks taken, and session count. These are displayed at the end of the program when the user decides not to continue and enters "n". 

My suggested session times are:
Work: 25 mins,
Break: 5 mins,
Long Break: 10 mins
